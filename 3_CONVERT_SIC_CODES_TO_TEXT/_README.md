The input.csv seen here should be a concatenated version of the outputs from step 2 (COMPARE).

Make sure that the concatenated csv you create doesn't include any repeated entries/erroneous column header rows at the joining points.

When this stage (CONVERT_SIC_CODES_TO_TEXT) completes, the end product is input.csv (now having been amended in place with the new columns.)
